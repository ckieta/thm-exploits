### IDORs
If a url contains parameters such as: http://vulnerable_url/profile?user_id=1305
a hacker could try to change the user_id to a different value.

Often these values are encoded base64, and can easily be decoded.
Hashed values can be cracked with databases such as: https://crackstation.net/

IDOR detection can be done with two accounts and their user_id values. 
A user should not be able to view another's content with their own user_id value.

This sometimes requires parameter mining.
