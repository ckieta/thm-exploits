### IDOR
If a website contains a url parameter such as: http://vulnerable_url/profile?user_id=1305
a hacker can attempt to change the user_id to another number.

If this ID is hashed, https://crackstation.net/ is a database of billions of hash to value results 
and can be used to see if there are any matches.

IDOR vulnerabilities can also be tested by swapping the IDs of two valid accounts. 
A user should not be able to see the other's content with their own ID.

IDOR vulnerabilities sometimes require parameter mining.
